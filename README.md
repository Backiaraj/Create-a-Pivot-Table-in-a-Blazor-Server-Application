# Create a Pivot Table in a Blazor Server Application

This is a quick-start project that helps you create the Syncfusion Blazor Pivot Table using the `dotnet add` command of Blazor schematics. This example explains how to add required fields in the Blazor Pivot Table and shows you how to add useful features to your Pivot Table too, like a grouping bar, filtering, formatting, and a field list.
